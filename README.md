## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about using data to make better decisions and solve real-world problems. With experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and cloud computing, I love working on data-driven projects that have a societal impact.
I’ve recently had the opportunity to work on refining AI language models, where I collaborated with multiple global teams to enhance the contextual accuracy and relevance of model outputs. This hands-on experience deepened my interest in prompt engineering and human-AI alignment—areas I’m excited to keep exploring and growing in.
